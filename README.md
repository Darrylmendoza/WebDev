This system takes student information as inputs and stores them in a table to record their enrollment, during this registration they are required to choose BSCS or ACT from the dropdown also acting as an input so the system would have a flag for them to know which sub table to put the information in. The main site has three tables, main table showing ID's and full information input by the registrar, and 2 sub tables that shows the names of students enrolled in the specific course, almost like sorting.
